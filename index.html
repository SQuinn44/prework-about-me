      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a social media manager for a local hardware supply store in my 9 to 5 job. I also run a side business as a travel and wedding photographer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Overland Park and have lived here for twenty-eight years now. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love photography and editing photos, as well as most art projects. Painting, graphic design, and a little bit of woodworking are a few of my favorite things to do. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To be a full time travel photographer taking photos of resorts, families on vacation and destination weddings. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Leawood, but am hoping to one day spend a year or so in Ireland.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be more self-sufficient within my own business. Designing websites is a large part of photography and to be able to do that for myself will allow me more freedom than before. I could also help other photographers with entire web design packages. </p>
